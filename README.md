# Ticket Machine Project
*****************************************************************

This is ticket machine project code written by Getachew Gessesse.

My ID is 346369507.

This project is for a drugstore customer service purpose. Here the customer will choose different
sites of the drugstore that he want to visit.

This device asks you what activity you've come to complete and gives you a turn number based
on the activity you chose.

In this example, you are going to design it for a drugstore that focuses on perfumery,
pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.
Your program will ask the consumer which of the places they wish to visit, and depending on the
area they choose, it will assign them a relevant turn number.

I used python 3 and pycharm to write the code.
This project has three main parts named: pizza_apps, pizza_main and pizza_utiles.
On pizza_apps file there is the main code of the project, on pizza_main file,
there is call for every function and on pizza_utiles, there is help function 
called random inorder to help the customer to play luck game and get discount.

At the end of the program, the program calculates the total price of the pizza
orders with the discount value and gives result for the customers.
